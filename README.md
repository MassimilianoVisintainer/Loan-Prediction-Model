## Loan Prediction Model

### Introduction

This repository contains the code for a Loan Status prediction system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. The code is based on a Jupyter notebook originally generated by Colab.

### Functionality

This code performs the following tasks:

* **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning with scikit-learn.
* **Data Loading and Exploration:**
  * Loads the loan dataset (`train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i (1).csv`) into a pandas dataframe.
  * Explores the data by displaying the first few rows (using `head()`), checking its shape (number of rows and columns), and identifying missing values.
  * Handles missing values by dropping rows with missing entries (using `dropna()`).
  * Analyzes the distribution of loan status compared to other features like education and marital status using seaborn visualizations (`countplot`).
* **Data Preprocessing:**
  * Converts categorical features like "Education", "Married" etc. into numerical values for machine learning compatibility.
  * Replaces string values with numerical codes (e.g., "Graduate" -> 1, "Not Graduate" -> 0).
  * Handles string values exceeding a certain limit (e.g., "3+" replaced with 4).
* **Feature and Label Split:**
  * Separates the features (independent variables) from the target label (Loan_Status).
* **Train-Test Split:**
  * Splits the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
  * Stratifies the split to ensure the class distribution is preserved in both sets.
* **Model Training:**
  * Trains an SVM model with a linear kernel using `svm.SVC` from scikit-learn.
  * Fits the model to the training data.
* **Evaluation:**
  * Evaluates the model's accuracy on both training and testing data using `accuracy_score`.
  * Reports the accuracy scores for both sets.

**Note:** This is a basic example of Loan Status prediction using SVM. Additional feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning can be explored for potentially improved performance.
